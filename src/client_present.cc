// See client_present.h for the module overview. This is step 2 ENTRY FUSION: the
// three former registries (gWalks glide / gDeferred attack-replay / gDoors slide)
// are folded into ONE table keyed by netId, one PresEntry per presented object.
// An object is legitimately BOTH a moving critter AND an attack/take-out replay
// participant at once (a wielding critter's held approach; a defender fleeing the
// same beat it is hit; a reserved participant still gliding into range), so the
// entry carries three ORTHOGONAL concerns side by side — not a single linear state:
//
//   • GLIDE   — live iff `hops` is non-empty. Plays a walk/run cycle and glides the
//               sprite between tiles for each authoritative MOVE hop; lags obj->tile
//               behind authority mid-glide (present-tile rebucketing, #6/#9).
//   • REPLAY  — `replay` ∈ {None, Reserved, Active}. Reserved at ATTACK_RESULT /
//               decode (holds the settled fid/flags/rotation so the corpse
//               pose doesn't beat the fall animation); Active while a reg_anim
//               sequence is in flight.
//
// The entry exists iff any concern is live; when a concern ends, the entry is
// dropped only once ALL are empty (eraseIfEmpty). The old cross-module
// `replaySuspended` flag + its per-frame setter are GONE — "the glide's tripwire is
// suspended while its own replay owns the pixels" is now the DERIVED predicate
// glideSuspended() (replay Active && the glide is still parked/unposed).
//
// The load-bearing invariant is unchanged: sim state (obj->tile/elevation, hp/ap,
// inventory) is ALWAYS the wire's latest authoritative value, applied at decode;
// this module only paces the PIXELS (MP_PROTOCOL.md §1: behind = snap forward,
// never replay). Off by default; only mainClientViewer enables it (presSetEnabled),
// so the headless joining client and every golden gate stay byte-identical.
