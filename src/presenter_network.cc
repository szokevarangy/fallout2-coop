// WIRE FORMAT v1 (MP_PROTOCOL.md §2). Little-endian, byte-packed, no padding.
//
// Stream once:   magic "F2NS" | u16 version=1
// Frame:         u32 seq | u32 simTs | u32 payloadLen | u16 eventCount | payload
// Event:         u8 type | u8 flags | u16 len | payload[len]
//
// FRAMING (§1): the FRAME is the atomic transport unit and carries the sequence
// number; events inherit (seq, simTs) from their frame's header. A per-event seq
// would be redundant state that must never disagree with frame order. Gap
// detection survives intact: a missed frame seq means every event in it was
// missed — exactly the "request snapshot + resync" case. There is no partial-frame
// case, because payloadLen makes a frame length-prefixed and atomically applicable.
// The frame boundary is the BEAT (Presenter::beatEnd) — the sim's resolution
// quantum, and already what objectDeltaScan batches on, so no finer boundary exists.
//
// FORWARD COMPAT: every event is length-prefixed, so an unknown type is skipped
// whole (skip-unknown-T). New fields append; readers stop at len.
//
// STRINGS ARE **NOT UTF-8**. u16 length + RAW bytes. Fallout .msg text is
// codepage-encoded, so consoleMessage/floatText/errorBox carry high-ASCII bytes
// verbatim (this is also why the golden gates need `grep -a` and why replay.py
// opens with errors="replace"). A consumer MUST treat these as opaque bytes and
// transcode at the presentation layer, never at the wire layer.
//
// move.durMs HAS A PRODUCER since the stepped-walk engine (F2_SERVER_SMOOTH_WALK,
// server_anim.cc): stepped hops stamp their sim-ms-per-tile pace via
// presenterSetNextMoveDurationMs; every other mover — teleports, scripted
// placement, within-beat sync moves, all golden paths — leaves it 0 = snap. The
// client uses durMs>0 as its animate-vs-snap discriminator and slaves per-hop
// animation DURATION to it; art fps selects frames only (§7). turnStart.deadlineMs
// remains a reserved always-0 slot with no producer; do not "fix" that zero.
