//
// The two differ in exactly one structural way, and it is worth stating because
// it is why this is a separate function rather than a flag on the other one:
// OUT of combat the approach is unbounded and spans beats, so it needs the latch
// (walk now, fire whenever you arrive). IN combat the approach is bounded by the
// actor's remaining AP and resolves inside this call — vanilla passes
// `critter->data.critter.combat.ap` to animationRegisterMoveToObject rather than
// -1 (actions.cc:1488), so the walk stops when the AP runs out. There is nothing
// left to span beats, so there is no latch, no beat cap, and no stale-target
// re-resolution window: the intent is spent here or not at all.
//
// AP for the OUTCOME is charged by the vanilla bodies themselves, not here —
// _check_scenery_ap_cost (3 AP) inside the use/pickup paths, and the 2 AP wrapper
// for use-item-on. Charging it again at this layer would double-bill.
