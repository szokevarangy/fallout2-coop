// f2_server control plane — the FIRST CONTROLLABLE CLIENT (P5-C STEP 6,
// [[p5-server-plan]]). Wire clients (the SDL viewer) send newline text intents
// upstream on the MAIN socket; the server executes them authoritatively over the
// live simulation. Unlike the debug CommandListener (F2_SERVER_CMD, unrestricted),
// the viewer wire is RESTRICTED to this small verb set and gated by a per-client
// claim: exactly one connection may drive the authoritative actor at a time.
//
// This is deliberately NOT commandDispatch (command.cc): that dispatcher is shared
// with the F2_PROBE_ACTIONS golden harness and speaks the full unrestricted debug
// vocabulary. Threading session identity + a trust boundary into it would couple a
// golden fixture to the network trust model. The control plane is its own gate.
//
// v1 wire framing is plain text "verb [arg] [arg2]\n" (the same v0 the debug port
// speaks); a typed binary command frame + per-client acks are the banked upgrade
// once the protocol is frozen (MP_PROTOCOL.md C2S, REWRITE_PLAN 3.4).
//
// Verbs:
//   claim              grant control to the sending session (if unclaimed)
//   mv <tile> <run>    move the authoritative actor to an absolute tile; run!=0
//                      runs. Honored only from the current claimant, out of combat.
//   cattack [target]   (in combat) queue an attack intent; target = Object id, or
//                      absent/-1 = nearest hostile. Claimant-only.
//   cmove <tile>       (in combat) queue a combat move-to-tile intent. Claimant-only.
//   cendturn           (in combat) queue an end-turn intent. Claimant-only.
//   cendcombat         (in combat) queue an attempt-to-end-combat intent (vanilla
//                      RETURN; refuses if hostiles remain). Claimant-only.
//   cstart             (OUT of combat) request entering combat — the wire equivalent
//                      of vanilla's 'A' toggle (_combat(nullptr)). Claimant-only; the
//                      server loop honors it on its idle tick (serverControlConsume-
//                      PendingCombatStart).
//   use/usedoor <net>  use a scenery object (door/lever/ladder/stairs) at wire
//                      netId — walk adjacent, then run the real engine action
//                      (INTERACTION_UX_DESIGN.md). usedoor is the slice-1 alias
//                      kept for door-only clients. Claimant-only.
//   get <net>          pick up a ground item at netId (walk-then-get).
//   look <net>         examine any object at netId — streams its description as
//                      console text. No approach, no AP, legal in combat.
//   push <net>         shove a pushable critter at netId. No approach.
//   rot [-1|1]         rotate one step (default clockwise). No target.
//   skill <net> <sk>   use skilldex skill <sk> on netId (walk-then-skill). <sk> is
//                      allow-listed to the eight skilldex skills. In combat vanilla
//                      refuses seven of them with proto msg 902 and toggles Sneak.
//   invopen/invclose   (IN combat) request / release the inventory screen. The open
//                      is the priced act — 4 AP, 2 with Quick Pockets, charged once
//                      and nothing for the actions inside. Granted by
//                      EVENT_INVENTORY_GRANT addressed to the asking actor. Out of
//                      combat the viewer opens locally and never sends these.
//
// STAGE 4 — IN-COMBAT INTERACTION. The acting verbs above are no longer dropped in
// combat. There they are QUEUED as COMBAT_INTENT_INTERACT stamped with the issuer's
// registry slot and executed by the combat pump on that actor's OWN turn, charging
// the vanilla AP (3 for use/loot, 2 for use-item-on, 4 to open the inventory —
// see combat_ap.h for the single switch that disables all of it). The approach walk
// is AP-limited and resolves within the turn rather than spanning beats, so in
// combat there is no walk-then-act latch. TALK stays dropped in combat: mid-fight
// conversation has no vanilla behavior to be faithful to, and dialog is host-only.
//   talk <net>         (OUT of combat) start dialog with a critter at netId (walk-
//                      then-talk). Verb exists; the viewer menu does not wire it until
//                      dialog-options streaming (INTERACTION_UX_DESIGN.md §5).
//   cancel             (OUT of combat) abort the pending walk-then-act intent and
//                      stop the in-flight approach where it stands. Claimant-only.
//
// The combat verbs push dude combat intents (combat_intent.h); the resumable-combat
// player barrier drains them on the dude's turn. Out of combat they are dropped
// (the click path uses mv); one queued during an AI turn waits for the dude's turn.

// Begin an inbound drain: release the claim if its owner has disconnected
// (queried via `liveSession`) and reset the per-beat per-session flood counters.
// MUST run each beat before serverControlLine, so a client that dropped last beat
// frees the claim for a new claimant this beat, and the disconnect check happens
// in the drain (not inside serverControlLine) — pollInbound's onLine must not
// touch the client set.

// stderr-only.

// from the dialog / movie / barter pumps, even though those also service inbound
// lines. Spawning requests a rebaseline, which re-mints every netId; doing that

// travel relocates everyone whereas a conversation only commits its own outcome.
//
// It also repairs an asymmetry rather than inventing one: `talk` never had a host
// gate while `dsay`/`dend` did, so an extra could open a conversation and then not
// answer it — the rule was being enforced at the wrong end.
//
// Identity is the registry SLOT, not the session or the netId, for the usual
// reason: a conversation can outlive neither, but the slot is durable.

// while drive was host-only — so a host who dropped mid-conversation left the
// server spinning in the barrier forever: a claimant still existed, so no bail,
// but only the host could answer, so no answer. "Someone is connected" was never
// the right question; "the one player who can answer is still here" is.

// passes the actor's remaining AP to animationRegisterMoveToObject —
