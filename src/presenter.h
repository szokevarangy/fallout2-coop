// -- TIME-SKIP MOVE COALESCING --------------------------------------------
// A script game-time skip (game_time_advance) advances the world by minutes or
// days inside ONE server tick: every queued event and every NPC AI catches up
// synchronously, and each tile step of that catch-up would otherwise emit its
// own paced objectMoved. Measured worst case: 320 MOVE events in a single beat
// (denbus2 / Sheila; next-busiest beat in the same run: 74). The viewer has no
// backpressure, so it then owes minutes of glide animation for a world that
// already finished moving — which is what the denbus2 dialog "softlock" is.
//
// Backpressure can never fix this: the avalanche is emitted in one tick, before
// any feedback from the viewer could arrive. The world advanced UNWATCHED, so
// the correct presentation is final positions, not the walk that produced them.
//
// Inside a skip window objectSetLocation records each object's ORIGIN tile
// (first move only) instead of emitting, and presenterTimeSkipEnd() emits one
// objectMoved per object that actually ended up somewhere else — durMs unstamped,
// i.e. a snap. Reentrant (nested Begin/End nest; only the outermost emits).
